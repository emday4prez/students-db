### 1. Requirements
To use this database, you need the following:

- PostgreSQL: Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed on your system. You can download it from the official PostgreSQL website.

### 2. Installation
To set up the Students Database, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Ensure that PostgreSQL is running on your system.
4. Execute the "students.sql" script using the following command:
   ```
   psql -U <username> -d <database_name> -f students.sql
   ```
   Replace `<username>` with your PostgreSQL username and `<database_name>` with the desired name for your database.

### 3. Usage
Once the script is executed successfully, you can start using the Students Database. Here are a few guidelines:

- Connect to the PostgreSQL database using your preferred client or command-line interface.
- Use the appropriate SQL commands to interact with the database. See the next section for details on available queries and operations.
- Modify the database schema or add more functionality as per your requirements.

### 4. Database Schema
The Students Database includes the following tables:

- `students`: Stores information about individual students, such as their ID, name, email, and enrollment date.

The database schema provides a basic structure for managing student data. You can extend it by adding more tables or additional columns to existing tables.

### 5. Queries and Operations
Here are some examples of queries and operations you can perform on the Students Database:

- Insert a new student into the database:
  ```
  INSERT INTO students (id, name, email, enrollment_date) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'johndoe@example.com', '2023-01-01');
  ```

- Retrieve all students from the database:
  ```
  SELECT * FROM students;
  ```

- Update a student's email address:
  ```
  UPDATE students SET email = 'newemail@example.com' WHERE id = 1;
  ```

- Delete a student from the database:
  ```
  DELETE FROM students WHERE id = 1;
  ```

Feel free to explore the database and experiment with different queries to suit your specific needs.
